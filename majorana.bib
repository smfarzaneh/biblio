  comment   = {Majorana excitations are not fermions but non-abelian anyons.
Exchange involves braid group in 2D rather than the permutation group in 3D. 
Fractional quantum Hall state 1/3 is abelian whereas the 5/2 state is persumably non-abelian. 
Bogoliubov excitation is mid gap and a linear combination of an electron and a hole and could be a candidate because they are anyonic. 
spinless p-wave superconductors can host these mid gap states. 
The rest of the article is about the nanowire proposal.},
